# iLluminati
iLluminati is a GUI for futurerestore by tihmstar. It's currently in the alpha stage, so
# I highly don't recommend you using it on your main device.
This should work only in theory. I didn't test it. This is why I don't recommend you using it with your main device.
iLluminati currently only compatible with macOS, but if you're a developer, you'll understand what to change to make it work on linux.
# Running:
- Install node.js from nodejs.org
- In terminal run:
- cd /path/to/illuminati/folder
- npm start
After this, you'll see a new window.
